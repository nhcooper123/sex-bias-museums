\section*{Supplementary Methods and Results}

\subsection*{Numbers of specimens for each species}

We expect large skews in the proportion of male or female specimens when sample size is low, but the ratio of male:female specimens should approach 50:50 as more specimens are added if there is no bias. 
Most species in our dataset were represented by only a few specimens (Figure \ref{fig-histograms}), with large skews in the percentage of female specimens (in both directions) at low numbers (Figure \ref{fig-hex}).

To test whether this may influence our analyses, we used generalised linear models (GLM) with binomial errors, with the proportion of female specimens (success) and the proportion of male specimens (failure) for each species as the response variable, and the log number of specimens per species as the explanatory variable. 
We then used standard model checks for GLMs (Q-Q plot, histogram of residuals, residuals vs. linear predictors, response vs. fitted values) to assess model fit. 
The model showed massive heteroscedasticity in the residuals, due to the skew in proportions when sample size is low. 
We therefore repeated the analysis, removing species with fewer than 20, 50, 100, 150 and 200 specimens in turn. 
The best fitting model, without losing too much data, was a model with species with more than 100 specimens. 
There is still a significant positive relationship between the number of specimens and the proportion of female specimens but this is not unusual with such a large dataset, and the effect size is extremely low ($slope \pm SE = 0.034 \pm 0.001$, $z_3257 = 24.86$, $p < 0.001$) so we exclude this variable from further analyses.

\subsection*{Exploring the unsexed specimen data}

49\% of bird specimens and 15\% of mammal specimens had no data on their sex at all. This is likely related to a number of factors. 
First, sexing birds and mammals is not always straightforward. Some species do not have clear external diagnostic features, so require dissection or close inspection by experts. 
In some bird species, for example, juvenile males and adult females may have very similar plumage, making differentiation difficult. 
Not all collectors or curators will have the skills to make these decisions, so collections remain unsexed. 
Second, historical collections often have poor metadata, in part because no-one imagined a time when you might examine the records without the specimen in front of you - as such many obviously male and female specimens are not recorded as such in specimen catalogues (this is common in the NHM collections \textit{pers. comm}).
 Curators and collections managers are often too busy to add these data when collections are massive and in need of much care and attention. 

We cannot sex all of the 687,393 unsexed bird and 161,526 unsexed mammals specimens in this study, instead we investigated variation in the numbers of unsexed specimens by order, collection continent and collection decade. 
Note that the figures below use all unsexed specimens, i.e. we did not exclude species with \textless 100 specimens.

  Points are the mean percentage of unsexed specimens across all species collected within a continent. 
  Error bars are standard errors.}
  \label{fig-nosex-continent}
\end{figure}

There is a lot of variation in the percentage of unsexed specimens across orders (Figure \ref{fig-nosex-orders}), regions (Figure \ref{fig-nosex-continent}) and through time (Figure \ref{fig-nosex-decade}). 
Interestingly, while the percentage of unsexed mammals has steadily decreased through time, in birds there is a steady decrease until 1900 followed by a slow increase towards the present. 
Patterns across orders and regions are not easily explained by the presence of hard to sex species.

\subsection*{Do unsexed specimens bias our results towards males?}

The presence of unsexed specimens may bias our results in various ways, but the worst possible scenario is that the majority of unsexed specimens are females, leading to the male bias we report in the main text. 
If this were true, we would expect the percentage of unsexed specimens to be strongly negatively correlated with the percentage of female specimens when we only consider female and male specimens. 
So, for example, a species with 50\% female and 50\% male specimens would have a higher percentage of unsexed specimens than one with 90\% female and 10\% male. 

We tested this by fitting linear models to compare the percentage of unsexed specimens (in species with more than 100 specimens overall) and the percentage of female specimens (in species with more than 100 sexed specimens). 
We investigated the correlation at two taxonomic levels 1) mean percentages within each order and 2) mean percentages within each species.

\subsubsection*{Within orders}
There were no significant correlations between the percentage of unsexed specimens and the percentage of female specimens across orders in either birds (linear regression: $slope ± SE = 0.143 \pm 0.359$, $t = 0.398$, $df = 23$, $p = 0.694$; Figure \ref{fig-nosex-correlation}) or mammals (linear regression: $slope \pm SE = 0.225 \pm 0.513$, $t = 0.439$, $df = 23$, $p = 0.665$; Figure \ref{fig-nosex-correlation}).

  Lines are from a linear regression, and shaded bars represent 95\% confidence intervals on the model.}
  \label{fig-nosex-correlation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Within species}
There was no significant correlation between the percentage of unsexed specimens and the percentage of female specimens across species in birds (linear regression: $slope \pm SE = 0.092 \pm 0.050$, $t = 1.876$, $df = 1743$, $p = 0.061$; Figure \ref{fig-nosex-correlation2}), but there was a weak negative correlation in mammals (linear regression: $slope \pm SE = -0.120 \pm 0.042$, $t = -2.852$, $df = 1487$, $p = 0.004$; Figure \ref{fig-nosex-correlation2}). 
The effect size was very small, however, so we do not place much emphasis on this result.

Note that without sexing the unsexed specimens we cannot be sure a bias does not exist, but the lack of correlation (except the weak one within species for mammals) makes us believe our results are likely not driven by unsexed specimens being predominantly female.

\subsection*{Comparing our sex ratios to wild adult sex ratio data for birds}

There is very little available data on sex ratios in wild bird populations. The study which has collated the most data so far is Szekely et al. (2014). We took their data and compared the wild adult sex ratios (number of males/ number of males + number of females) to the sex ratios of the matching species in our dataset.

Overall we found 119 overlapping species out of the 187 in Szekely et al. (2014)\cite{szekely2014sex}.
Of these 88 (74\%) have less male biased sex ratios in the wild compared to museums, while the remaining 31 (26\%) have more male biased sex ratios in the wild compared to museums. 
This difference was significant (paired t-test: $t_{118} = -6.768$, $p < 0.001$; Figure \ref{fig-asr})

  The dotted lines represents 50\% female specimens in either the wild or museum ASR data. 
  The red dashed line is the 1:1 line representing where points would sit of wild ASR and museum ASR are identical for a given species.
  Points above this line indicate species where museum ASR is more male biased than in wild populations.

\subsection*{Apodiformes}

The order Apodiformes consists of three families hummingbirds (Trochilidae), swifts (Apodidae) and treeswifts (Hemiprocnicadae).
Hummingbirds are sexually dimorphic, but swifts are not. 
To investigate this in more detail we split this order into the three families and look at the percentage of females in each family. 
As suspected if sexual plumage dimorphism affects the percentage of female specimens, we see that on average hummingbirds have fewer female specimens than swifts (hummingbirds = 35.4\% from 51 species; swifts = 48.2\% from 10 species; tree swifts = 47\% from 3 species; Figure \ref{fig-apod}).

\subsection*{Reverse sexual dimorphism in birds}

Some bird species show reverse sexual dimorphism, where females are larger or showier than the males. 
This occurs in hawks and vultures (Accipitridae), falcons (Falconidae), sandpipers and snipe (Scolopacidae), phalaropes (Charadriidae), jacanas (Jacanidae), skuas (Stercorariidae), boobies (Sulidae), frigate birds (Fregatidae), owls (Strigiformes), cuckoos (Cuculidae), hummingbirds (Trochilidae), manakins (Pipridae), and some ratites (Struthioniformes) (Swaddle et al. 2000\cite{swaddle2000novel}). 
The sexual size dimorphism and sexual plumage dimorphism analyses in the main text deal with this quantitatively and within the same framework as more typical male based sexual dimorphism. 
This is a better technique than lumping species into male versus female dominated dimorphism groupings, as the variation among sexes can vary hugely within these. 
For example, in European grouse species where the male capercaillie (\textit{Tetrao urogallus}) are more than twice the mass of females, while hazel grouse (\textit{Tetrastes bonasia}) females are only a gram heavier than males (Amadon, 1959\cite{amadon59}). 
However, our method had limitations - we did not have male and female body size for all species, and we only had plumage data for Passeriformes. 
As such we may have missed important patterns.

To deal with this, we divided the bird data into species where the female is generally the larger or showier sex (the families  Accipitridae, Falconidae, Scolopacidae, Charadriidae, Jacanidae, Stercorariidae, Sulidae, Fregatidae, Cuculidae, Trochilidae, Pipridae, and the orders Strigiformes and Struthioniformes), and species where the male is generally the larger or showier sex (all other species). We then compared the median percentage of females within species of the two groups, and fitted generalized linear models with quasibinomial errors to test for significant differences. 

Overall we found that the median percentage of females for species where the male was the larger or showier sex was 40\%, the same as for the whole dataset. 
For species where the female is the larger or showier sex the median percentage of females was 44.6\%, closer to the expected 50:50 ratio. 
There were significantly more females in species where the female is the larger or showier sex (quasibinomial GLM: $F_{1,1744} = 167.9$, $p < 0.001$; Figure \ref{fig-reverse})
